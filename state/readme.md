State finds itself in most softwares. For games, this pattern will certainly be seen, we can give our character states in order to modulate things. 
Now, if you never implemented this pattern before, State is a little bit more than just enums and a large switch statement, each state actually gets its own class, and
this allows for some cool stuff. 

To run, make sure you can installed SFML, and then you can run 
```
 g++ badDemo.cpp -o badDemo.out -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system 
 ./badDemo.out
```
